# Vue.js and Vite CLI Feature Demonstration
This repository is a step-by-step guide to add a new boilerplate feature to a *VueJS* and *Vite* project.

Each commit here adds a new feature to the project, and you can use a Git tree view to see the changes for each commit.

Every flow of adding features ends with a tag with the order of added features.

## contributing

The master branch contains a `zsh` script that can be used to create a new flow for adding additional features.
